# Git Practice
A simple project to practice a few git/github workflows.  Replace the contents of this file with the contents indicated in the [instructions](./instructions.md).

Here's the most recent [Kickstart update article](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ratata-arts/ratatan/posts/4004502) of an in-development indie-game called Ratatan.

In this article, they breakdown what they've did during this developmental phase and what this verticle slice is aiming for. It gives a lot of insight to what's happening behind a software's development and the mindset behind these overall developmental decision makings.

They've also explained the importance of interaction / communication between group members in the dev team, which they came up with different sorts of method to help different parts of the dev team to work together better under this grand plan that is developing this game in time. I personally think their updates are really good examples of what a software dev team should work like, and it definitely helped me a lot in terms of getting more insights by reading their updates.
